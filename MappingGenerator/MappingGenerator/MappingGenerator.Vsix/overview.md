## Description
Extension that allows you to easily generate an implementation for mapping methods. This generator mimics well known AutoMapper. No more dull code typing. [Check the full list of features](https://github.com/cezarypiatek/MappingGenerator).

## Further Development
If you find this extension useful (you feel it helps you on the daily basis) you can support further development by buying me a coffee (it's simple, just click the button below and follow further instructions). Sometimes it's hard to stay awake till midnight implementing new features, coffee helps me with that. I really appreciate your support in any form.
